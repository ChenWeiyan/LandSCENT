Package: LandSCENT
Title: Landscape Single Cell Entropy
Version: 0.99.2
Description: LandSCENT (Landscape Single Cell Entropy) is a R-package 
        for the analysis of single-cell RNA-Seq data. One important 
        feature of this package is the computation of signaling entropy, 
        which allows single cells to be ordered according to differentiation 
        potency. LandSCENT also integrates cell density with potency 
        distribution to dissect cell types across all potency states 
        and generates high-quality figures to show this.
