Package: LandSCENT
Title: Landscape Single Cell Entropy
Version: 0.99.0
Description: LandSCENT (Landscape Single Cell Entropy) is an R-package for 
        the analysis of single-cell RNA-Seq data. The most 
        important feature of this package is the computation 
        of signaling entropy, which allows single cells to 
        be ordered according to differentiation potency.
