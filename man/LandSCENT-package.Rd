\title{Landscape Single Cell Entropy}
\description{
\pkg{LandSCENT} (Landscape Single Cell Entropy) is a R-package for the 
analysis of single-cell RNA-Seq data. One important feature of this 
package is the computation of signaling entropy, which allows single 
cells to be ordered according to differentiation potency. \pkg{LandSCENT} 
also integrates cell density with potency distribution to dissect cell types
across all potency states and generates high-quality figures to show this.
}
\details{
\packageIndices{LandSCENT}
\pkg{LandSCENT} will be of interest to those analysing 
single-cell RNA-Sequencing data. A core component of \pkg{LandSCENT} 
is the computation of signaling entropy at the single-cell level
(\code{CompSRana}), allowing cells to be ordered according to
differentiation potency or phenotypic plasticity. It also incorporates
functionality for quantifying intercellular heterogeneity, for identifying
interesting subpopulations of cells that differ in terms of potency or
plasticity, as well as to infer dependencies between single cell
clusters, which for instance can help identify lineage trajectories.
